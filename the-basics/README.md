**String Interpolation**: It is used to just display a piece of data in HTML, such as displaying a title or a name.

**Property Binding**: It binds a property of a DOM object, for example the hidden, innertext, setAttribute, replaceChild property (etc.), to some data value.

**Event Binding**: It listens for and responds to user actions such as keystrokes, mouse movements, clicks, and touches.

**Two-Way Binding**: It listens for events and update values simultaneously between parent and child components.
